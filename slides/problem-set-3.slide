* Overview

- Formulate an algorithm to draw a line on a computer screen
- Not mandatory, do not need to hand in anything. 

* Background 
- Images on a computer screen is a collection of colored pixels
- The screen is arranged as a two-dimensional coordinate system with (0,0) in the top left corner and (1023,767) for 1024x768 displays

* Description

Assignment is divided into four steps: 

1. Draw an *horizontal* line
2. Draw a *vertical* line
3. Draw a line with a 45 degree slope
4. Draw a line between two coordinates

* How to draw anything on the screen

- Use a graphics library called [[http://www.libsdl.org/][SDL]]
- Don't need to know the details yet, pre-code handles all the magic

* Code
Pre-code is availible on Fronter and includes the following files: 

- *drawline.h* - Specifies the interface of the drawline function. Do not modify this file. 
- *drawnline.c* - An empty stub for the drawline program. Insert your code here. 
- *Makefile* - Makefile for compiling code, if you are using Linux/Mac you need to modify this. 
- _SDL.dll_ - SDL for Windows. Don't worry about this one. 
- _include_ - More libraries for Windows. Don't worry about this one either. 



* Closer look at the pre-code

Lines 27-33 in _drawline.c_ 

    // Draw a line on the screen from x1,y1 to x2,y2
    void DrawLine(SDL_Surface *screen, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, unsigned int color)
    {
        
            // Complete this function

    }

- This is the function you are supposed to complete. 
- It takes 6 arguments: The screen, start and end locations for x and y axis and which color to use

* Closer look at the pre-code contd. 

Lines 56-60 in the main function of _drawline.c_ shows how to call the drawline function. It should draw a red horizontal line between(10,10) and (100,10). 


    // Example call (horizontal line). Remember to pass screen as first parameter.
    // The SDL_MapRGB function converts a RGB value to
    // a 32-bit value (each color is 8 bit)
    DrawLine(screen, 10, 10, 100, 10,
        SDL_MapRGB(screen->format, 0xff, 0, 0));


The _SDL__MapRGB_  function is defined as 

    Uint32 SDL_MapRGB(SDL_PixelFormat *fmt, Uint8 r, Uint8 g, Uint8 b);

meaning that you can change the color of the line by modifying the last three arguments.
