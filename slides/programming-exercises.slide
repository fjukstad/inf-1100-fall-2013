* Brief summary

- One *zip* file which should be named _userid-courseid-a+assignmentnumber_, e.g. _bfj001-inf1100-a2_
- This file should have the following structure when unzipped: 

    README
    src/
    doc/

- All your source code is placed in the _src/_ folder and the report is placed in _doc/_
- The _README_ file should contain the necessary information on how to run your code, e.g. how to compile and run it. 

* Report

- THE REPORT MUST BE IN PDF FORMAT
- If a report is delivered as _odt_, _doc_, _docx_ or any other than pdf the hand-in will be automatically rejected.
